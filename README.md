## Advanced Features and Best Practices for Historians
- Combine free-form "Zettelkasten" linking of ideas with structured data necessary to know who did what and when
- Sort your notes by source date, by source page number, and by event date (start-date and end-date) with Dataview
- Trace social networks: create and link person, place, and event notes and visualize with the Graph view
- Use the Kanban plugin as a Corkboard for writing, in a Scrivener-like setup 
### Basic Difference with the Zettelkasten method Zotero-Obsidian plugins (this is for Obsidian users)
- You __have__ to include source fields (author, title, year, etc.) in __all__ notes related to a particular source, not just in the "Literature Note." That's what makes precise Dataview searches possible. 
- You __have__ to export archive, archive-location, and recipient fields from Zotero into Obsidian because archival research (including private correspondence) is central for historical work.
- Because Zotero source can have several linked Obsidian notes, the title of your note (also your file title) should reflect the content of the note, in contrast to the established practice of using the source BibTex citekey as the title for the "Literature Note."
### Network Analysis
- Use Tags to categorize your notes
- Organize and explore your graph with Groups and Depth settings
- Create and use Templates for Person, Place, Event notes
### Search and Sort Sources with Dataview
- Import source info from Zotero into YAML fields
- Set up your own fields (event start-date and end-date; page number)
- Create a table of your source notes; sort by author and page no. (Community plugins: Safe mode - off; install Dataview plugin)
- Create a table of your archival sources; sort by archive location
- Create a table for a timeline of your notes
- Set up Dataview notes in a special folder
- Set up Dataview Workspace(s)
### Writing with Kanban as a Corkboard (Zettelkasten method used here)
- Create Analysis notes ("Permanent" notes in Zettelkasten parlance)
- Outline with a Corkboard (Community plugins: Safe mode - off; install Kanban plugin)
- Write with a Corkboard (Community plugins: Safe mode - off; install Longform plugin)
