# obsidian-history-notes
This basic research toolkit helps to get started on historical notetaking and analysis with Zotero and Obsidian. It does not require programming skills or command-line installation and does not rely on paid features in Zotero or Obsidian.
## Zotero Translators
Two translator files link Obsidian note to a Zotero item. They should be mapped to keystrokes in the Zutilo plugin (map "Markdown Item URI" to Shift-Command-1 and "Markdown Obsidian Dataview" to Shift-Command-2).
