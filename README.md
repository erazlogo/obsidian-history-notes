# Obsidian History Notes
This basic research toolkit helps to get started on historical notetaking and analysis with Zotero and Obsidian. It does not require programming skills or command-line installation and does not rely on paid features in Zotero or Obsidian. Two folders are included:
## Zotero Translators
Two translator files link Obsidian note to a Zotero item. They should be mapped to keystrokes in the Zutilo plugin (map "Markdown Item URI Citation" to Shift-Command-1 and "Markdown Obsidian Dataview" to Shift-Command-2).
## Obsidian template-project folder
A starter folder with several plugins preinstalled (Dataview, Kanban, Longform, Tag Wrangler and others). It includes several example notes and dataview tables.
