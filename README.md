This basic research toolkit helps to get started on historical notetaking and analysis with Zotero and Obsidian. It does not require programming skills or command-line installation and does not rely on paid features in Zotero or Obsidian.
## What's Included
### Two Zotero shortcuts
Two translator files link Obsidian note to a Zotero item. They should be mapped to keystrokes in the Zutilo plugin (map "Markdown Item URI Citation" to Shift-Command-1 and "Markdown Obsidian Dataview" to Shift-Command-2).
### Obsidian template-project folder
A starter folder with several plugins preinstalled (Dataview, Kanban, Longform, Tag Wrangler and others). It includes several example notes and Dataview tables.
## Installation
### Zotero
- Install Zotero https://www.zotero.org/
- Move two translator files to Zotero/translators folder
- Install Zutilo for Zotero and map translators to keyboard shortcuts https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo
- Install BetterBibTex if you plan to use citation dialogue in writing down the road (recommended; this feature is not yet fully supported in Obsidian) https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/
- Note: These steps will allow you to link any Markdown application to Zotero.
### Obsidian
- Install Obsidian https://obsidian.md/
- Move "template-project" folder to the Obsidian folder and open it as a vault
