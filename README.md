This basic research toolkit helps to get started on historical notetaking and analysis with Zotero and Obsidian. It does not require programming skills or command-line installation and does not rely on paid features in Zotero or Obsidian.

Note: if you have your own setup for linking Zotero and Obsidian, jump to [Advanced Features and Best Practices for Historians](https://github.com/erazlogo/obsidian-history-notes/blob/main/README.md#advanced-features-and-best-practices-for-historians)

## What's Included
### Two Zotero shortcuts
Two translator files link Obsidian note to a Zotero item. They should be mapped to keystrokes in the Zutilo plugin (map "Markdown Item URI Citation" to Shift-Command-1 and "Markdown Obsidian Dataview" to Shift-Command-2). Included above.
### Obsidian template-project "vault" folder
A starter vault (a storage unit for your notes) with several plugins preinstalled (see the list of plugins below). The vault includes several example notes and Dataview tables.
Download the "template-project" folder here: http://elenarazlogova.org/?attachment_id=314
### Four basic shortcuts
Use the following four shortcuts to transfer Zotero item data to Obsidian for linking and citation (a BibTex citekey is included in the Dataview export to support <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/cayw/">cite-as-you-write</a> down the road).  
- Shift-Command-1 - copy reference with links to an item in Zotero, online and locally on your computer
- Shift-Command-2 - copy a reference with links and fields for a reference to use for search and sorting with Dataview plugin
- Shift-Command-C - copy bibiliographic reference
- Shift-Command-A - copy footnote reference
### Obsidian Settings (changes to the default setup included in the "template-project" vault): 
- Editor: Readable line length (off)
- Files and Links: Automatically update internal links (on)
- Appearance: Dark/Light View (Light)
- Core plugins: Tag pane (on), Templates (on), Starred (on), Workspaces (on)
- Community plugins: Safe mode (off)
- Install community plugins: Tag Wrangler, Dataview, Kanban, Longform, Better Word Count, Footnote Shortcut, Reading Time, Focus Mode, Typewriter Scroll

## Advanced Features and Best Practices for Historians
- Combine free-form "Zettelkasten" linking of ideas with structured data necessary to know who did what and when
- Sort your notes by source date, by source page number, and by event date (start-date and end-date) with Dataview
- Trace social networks: create and link person, place, and event notes and visualize with the Graph view
- Use the Kanban plugin as a Corkboard for writing, in a Scrivener-like setup
