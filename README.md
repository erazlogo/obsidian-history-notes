# Obsidian History Notes
This basic research toolkit helps to get started on historical notetaking and analysis with Zotero and Obsidian. It does not require programming skills or command-line installation and does not rely on paid features in Zotero or Obsidian. Two folders are included:
## What's Included
### Two Zotero shortcuts
Two translator files link Obsidian note to a Zotero item. They should be mapped to keystrokes in the Zutilo plugin (map "Markdown Item URI Citation" to Shift-Command-1 and "Markdown Obsidian Dataview" to Shift-Command-2).
### Obsidian template-project folder
A starter folder with several plugins preinstalled (Dataview, Kanban, Longform, Tag Wrangler and others). It includes several example notes and dataview tables.
## Installation
### Obsidian
Install Obsidian
Install "template-project" vault
Turn on Live Preview (comes up at first launch)
Turn Safe Mode Off (comes up at first launch)
### Zotero
Install Zotero
Put two translator files into zotero/translators folder
Install Zutilo for Zotero and map translators to keyboard shortcuts
Install BetterBibTex if you plan to use citatin dialogue in writing down the road (this feature is not yet fully supported in Obsidian)
