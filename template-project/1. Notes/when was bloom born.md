“The most glaring omission in the story of his life in Ulysses is his date of birth. While we find out that Bloom was certainly born in 1866, quite surprisingly we are never told on what precise day or month this momentous event took place.” ([Crispi, 2012, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/items)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/items?page=3&annotation=784GR5UC))
